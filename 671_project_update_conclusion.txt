This project performs granger causality analysis on the student behavior data within a period of time, intended to explore the relationships between students' stress level and their daily behavior. Our results reveals the general pattern of students' behavior in dealing with stress -- their anxious level would peak soon after their stress level peak, and students' working hours demonstrates a leading influence on their stress scale to increase, with p-value reaching the smallest of all situations(p-value = 0.0010).

We are able to conclude that instead of sleeping hours affecting students' stress level, in fact it is their stress scale that would have a direct influence on sleeping hours, though in general sleeping hours and stress level are on the opposite direction of changing. Our analysis also unveils students' general approach to relieve stress -- they tend to exercise more and be more social to seek support from acquaintances not long after they get stressed out. 

In this project, one main goal is to predict students' stress scale based on the interactions with other factors. We build a Random Forest classifier to handle that. The results show that 73% of the students are classified as "stressful", which is slightly smaller to our baseline of 75%. This is partially due to the sparsity characteristic of our data set, including only 60 sampled students yet with over 80 features that are measured.
